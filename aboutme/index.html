    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>My name is Jose Martinez</h2>
    <img alt="Our family Picture after Esmeralda blassing" src="images/familypic.jpg" width="180" height="200" />
    <h2>Bits</h2>
    <p>My younger brother likes to call me "Bits" since he was little, because of that a lot of my family know me by
        that name. we are not sure why he chose that nick name. </p>
    <p>I was born in Guatemala but I moved to the US 20 years ago, since then we have lived in Idaho. My major is in
        Applied
        techniologies.
        I've been married for 5.5 years to my wife Amanda. we met in the young sinlgle adults ward in Caldwell Idaho and
        we have 4 children.
        we have a 4 year old her name is Chloe and she is the most stuborn 4 year old girl i've ever met, but she can be
        the sweetest girl too. we have 2 boys
        Spencer who is 2 years old and loves cars and his teddy bear and Aaron who is 1 that is a foody and loves
        blankets, I bet his celestial kingdom will be full of food and blankets.
        we have a second girl, her name is Esmeralda and she is 2 months old, I like to call her my spicy curly girl
        because she has curly hair and she gets mad very easly.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>My goal with this degree is to be able to gain a better job that would allow me to have more time at home for my
        family. My favorite scripture is Alma 7:11-12 because it talks about
        how the Lord atones for everything for us. Because of that infinite atonement I can be worthy of his glory, his
        blessings, and his miracles. I've seen so many miracles in my life
        and I know that with the Lord anything can be possible. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>P.S. This was proof read by my amazing wife that I love very much.</p>
