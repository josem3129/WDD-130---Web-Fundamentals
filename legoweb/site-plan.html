      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[Legos are one of my passions and in the Lego community we are creators who love to share our ideas and passion. But, sometimes we need to help each other to become successful. We need a way to communicate with each other to grow our hobby and a website that allows us to share our tools, tactics and ideas would provide that. This website would allow creators to exchange pieces with each other or sell the unneeded pieces. They could also sell vintage Lego sets to earn money to buy new pieces or sets and continue to grow their passion.]</p>  <!-- change this -->
